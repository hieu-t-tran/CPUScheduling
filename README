# DESCRIPTION:
This C program illustrates two CPU scheduling policies, Shortest Process Next (SPN) and Shortest Remaining Time (SRT). It reads data about the processes from the input file "input.dat" and
print out the results of the scheduling of those processes on the screen and on the output file "output.dat".



# INPUT:
The input should be in the file named "input.dat" in this directory. The format of this input file is some number of lines of two space-separated non-negative integers, such that the first
integer of a line is never larger than the first integer of the next line. The following is an example:

0 3
2 6
4 4
6 5
8 2

Each line represents a process to be scheduled, with the line number being the process ID, the first integer being the arrival time and the second integer being the service time.



# OUTPUT:
The output is written on the file named "output.dat" in this directory. If this file does not exist, it is created; otherwise, its content is discarded before writing the output. The
written output in this file contains information about how each process was scheduled, including the arrival time (A), service time (S), waiting time (W), finish time (F) and turnaround
time (T). For example, the following is the content of "output.dat" after running the program with the input above and using the SRT scheduling policy:

1 runs 0-3: A=0, S=3, W=0, F=3, T=3
2 runs 3-4
3 runs 4-8: A=4, S=4, W=0, F=8, T=4
5 runs 8-10: A=8, S=2, W=0, F=10, T=2
2 runs 10-15: A=2, S=6, W=7, F=15, T=13
4 runs 15-20: A=6, S=5, W=9, F=20, T=14

Additionally, the program also prints out the global average turnaround time, global average normalized turnaround time and global average waiting time on the screen. For example, for the
input above and using the SRT scheduling policy, the output on the screen is:

Average turnaround time = 7.200000
Average normalized turnaround time = 1.593333
Average waiting time = 3.200000



# USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Make sure the input file "input.dat" exists in the current directory, with the correct format specified above.

2. Open the terminal and go to the current directory.

3. Compile all source code and generate the executable with the makefile by typing:
	make
   Alternatively, if not using the makefile, we can also compile all source code and generate the executable by typing:
	gcc -o mydispatcher mydispatcher.c myutility.c spn.c srt.c

4.
- To run the program with the SPN scheduling policy, type:
	./mydispatcher input.dat SPN

- To run the program with the SRT scheduling policy, type:
	./mydispatcher input.dat SRT

5. (Only if using the makefile in step 3) After running, clean up all object files and executables by typing:
	make clean
